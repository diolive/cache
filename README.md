### How to work with this code
This code is based on daily release of .NET Core, so you have to install it.

2. Check your installed version via console command `dotnet --version` or just open folder with dotnet (C:\Program Files\dotnet\sdk on Windows). You will see something about `1.0.0-preview3-003221`.
3. Update target SDK version in `global.json` configuration file.
4. Restore packages with `dotnet --restore`.
5. Build and run ~~your~~ my app =)
